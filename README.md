# MuffleSpeech
a speech muffler

# Welcome
Welcome to the MuffleSpeech project.
Originally developed as a prototype for a larger project, this project is basically a character changer.

# Usage
This project works as follows:

    You load a profile...

            ...input a string...
           
                     ...and you recieve a muffled output.
                    
That's basically it. For the syntax you will have to call _HELP from the internal shell.

    (_E, _Q) _EXIT or _QUIT - Exit application
	(_H) _HELP - display this menu
    (_R) _RELOAD - reload character map
	(_A) _ABOUT - about the application
	Any other string not beginning with _ will be muffled according to the current loaded profile.
	The commands in brackets is the shortened form.

# Notes and warnings
To say that this project is not optimized is an understatment. This was slapped together in a few days and is based off an older prototype which was written in under an hour. Obviously this is not optimized for maximum performace. This is actually one of the reasons i'm publishing this here, it's so that you - the community can improve on this.
