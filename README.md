# Welcome
Welcome to the TPM/MuffleSpeech project.
Originally developed as a prototype for a larger project, this project is basically a character changer.

# In project
This project includes all the source code. For the releases, check the releases tab. Development releases are usually only for Linux.

# Notes and warnings
To say that this project is not optimized is an understatment. This was slapped together in a few days and is based off an older prototype which was written in under an hour. Obviously this is not optimized for maximum performace.
